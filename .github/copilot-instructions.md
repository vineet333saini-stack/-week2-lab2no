# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository includes guidance for Copilot to make helpful, safe, and consistent suggestions.

Guidelines
- Follow the repository's existing style and patterns.
- Prefer clarity and readability over clever one-liners.
- When adding functionality, include minimal tests or an example usage.
- Keep functions small and well-named; add brief docstrings where helpful.

Do not
- Do not add or expose secrets, credentials, or personal data.
- Do not introduce large, unrelated refactors in small PRs.

Repository context
- This project contains web assets (`assets/`) and assignment code (`assignments/`). Match those conventions.

If unsure, open an issue or a draft PR and describe the suggested change.
