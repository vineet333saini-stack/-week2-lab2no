### 🛠️ Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should display progress, track guessed letters, and show remaining incorrect attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a secret word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses and validate input
- Show current progress using underscores for unknown letters (e.g., `_ a _ g m a n`)
- Track and display remaining incorrect guesses
- End when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted and display a win/lose message
- Keep the code modular so core logic can be unit tested

Follow the starter code in `starter-code.py` and the project guidelines when formatting your `README.md`.
