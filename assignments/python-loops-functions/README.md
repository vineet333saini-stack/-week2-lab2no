# 📘 Assignment: Python Loops & Functions

## 🎯 Objective

Practice writing `for` and `while` loops as well as defining and calling functions in Python by solving a series of small problems.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Loop Practice

#### Description
Write a Python script that uses loops to iterate over a list of numbers and perform simple calculations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use a `for` loop to print the square of each number in a predefined list.
- Use a `while` loop to count down from 10 to 1 and then print "Liftoff!".

### 🛠️ Function Practice

#### Description
Extend the script by adding functions that encapsulate the loop logic and other behavior.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a function `print_squares(numbers)` that takes a list and prints each value squared.
- Define a function `countdown(start)` that uses a while loop to count down and prints "Liftoff!".
- Call both functions from `main()` and ensure the program runs when executed directly.
